# JavaScript Drum Simulator
This is a simple JavaScript Drum simulator. I created this using the keydown option in JavaScript, as you will need to type the following letters to play the different drum beats. I will be adding to, improving this simulator.
## Instructions
Use your keyboard to type the following letters: 
A,S,D,F,G,H,J,K,L to play the different drum beats.

## Installation
Simply type the following command line in your terminal, clone the project and play around with this simulator.
```python
git clone https://github.com/jamesdesigns/javascript-drum-kit.git
```
